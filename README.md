# Tenki
Your terminal weatherperson.

## Todo
[ ] api to pull single weather report
[ ] format terminal output (grids, unicode art) 
[ ] manually stored weather preferences, uncomment to load like setting mirrors manually when installing arch linux
[ ] dynamic search function, based on `pacman`'s wrapper `yay`, integrated with local 'mirrorlist'
[ ] upgrade to query weather provider api vs locally stored mirror list
