# Tenki
Your terminal weatherperson.

## Todo
- [ ] api to pull single weather report
- [ ] format terminal output (grids, unicode art) 
- [ ] manually stored weather preferences, uncomment to load like setting mirrors manually when installing arch linux
- [ ] dynamic search function, based on `pacman`'s wrapper `yay`, integrated with local 'mirrorlist'
- [ ] upgrade to query weather provider api vs locally stored mirror list
